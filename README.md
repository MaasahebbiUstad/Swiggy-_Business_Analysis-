- **Data Collection:** 
 The project commenced with the systematic collection of data from Swiggy, employing web scraping techniques using the BeautifulSoup library and Selenium. This ensured a robust           dataset, comprising information related to restaurant performance, customer preferences, and market trends.

- **Data Cleaning:** 
The collected data underwent meticulous cleaning and preprocessing to eliminate inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. This critical step ensures that subsequent analyses and modeling are based on high-quality, reliable data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
Thorough EDA was performed to uncover key patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. Insights from EDA provided a deeper understanding of customer behavior, restaurant performance metrics, and market dynamics.

- **Predictive Modeling:**
Advanced machine learning algorithms were employed to develop predictive models for key business aspects: price, best cuisine, and location. These models offer the capability to forecast restaurant-specific prices, optimal cuisine choices, and the most promising locations for new ventures.
